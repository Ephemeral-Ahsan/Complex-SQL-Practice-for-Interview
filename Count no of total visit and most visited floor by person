/* Count no of total visit and most visited floor by person */

create table entries (

address varchar(20),
email varchar(20),

resources varchar(10));

insert into entries

select * from entries;

/* 
my logic here -
1. at first, find out the most visited floor by name --table 1
2. then find out the total_visit and aggregate the distinct resources by name --table 2
3. join the tables on name
