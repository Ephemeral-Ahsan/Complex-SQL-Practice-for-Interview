/* hints 
1. first take out the first_player and first_score from matches table and  then using union all combine it with second_players and second_score from matches table.
2. then take the sum of score by player as total_score and join the existing table with players table and then rank the score by descending order to get the winner player.
3. if there are identical rank in each group then consider the smallest player id as winner.
