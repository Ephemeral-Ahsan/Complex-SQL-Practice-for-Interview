/* hints 
> first, I have extract the month from current order date for order id and then take the month of previous order if available otherwise it will give 'null' 
> then took difference of the current order month and previous order month. If the difference is 1, that means the customer is retained (means he shopped last month and also current month)
> then I have used case statement if month_diff = 1 then 1 and If null (means no previous month shopping) then 0 and then take summation over month_diff to take out the no_customer_retention

/* Part 2 */

--customer churn by month (churn is something,suppose cust A bought something in Jan but not in Feb that means in Jan, there is a churn cause cust A didn't buy anything in feb. 
here my result is 
month no_churn
  1       1
  2       4
 -- that's because cust 4 has bought in jan but no in february (next month after jan) so it's a churn
  and as well as, we have no data for march that means there no_churn is 4. there might be a question that we have 5 customers. but think concisely, cust 4 didn't buy anything in feb, so that means in march for cust 4 that won't be counted as churn.
    retention related to purchase in next month after purchase something in previous month
    churn related to purchase in current month but not in next month.
