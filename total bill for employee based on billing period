/* hints
1. first let's take the (second bill date - 1) as bill date ending period.
	and if there is no second bill date then put an arbitary unique value '9999-12-31' as bill date ending period
2. then just joined the table with HoursWorked table based on emp_name and filter it if work_date between bill_start_date and bill_end_date
